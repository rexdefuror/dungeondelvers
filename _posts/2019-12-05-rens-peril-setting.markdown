![Kingdom of Kigia](/dungeondelvers/assets/images/Kigia.png){:style="width:100%"}

The land of Kigia. Militaristic kingdom led by King Velubran Landram Ren and a group of sages called, Council of Grates. It is populated mostly by humans, but there are other species with the lands as well. Kings in the linage of Ren have ruled Kigia for more than thousand years, and while ruling with a firm totalitarian hand the kingdom has never refused to assist their neighbors in times of need, with the exception if they were in state of war. Nor have they ever allowed slavery to take root within it. The only thing they cared about was strength, if you are strong in body or mind you were treated better. Simple as that.

The principle of Strength as the locals called it was a common thing in Kigia, even things like judgment by combat existed and was offered to those who haven't committed any of the grave sins. Treason was considered the gravest sin of all, and that is exactly what led to the events of Great Rupture.

On the fifth day of Euros, fifth month of the year 3562, a horrifying event took place. Whole city of people was sacrificed in the attempt to summon a God into the world of Astana, and thus began the Age of Tempest.

Sages from the Council of Grates, betrayed their king and sacrificed their own people in order to further their power and influence in the world. However, they were themselves betrayed by the would-be God Thannanoth, the great demon general from another world, instead of summoning a God they summoned a power crystal from the demons home world that changed the spatial magic structure within Astana and started opening rift-like portals all around the world.
If one such rift remained open for more than several days, the rifts spatial structure would be complete and demons and monsters from various worlds would pour out from it, killing everything in their path.

But the world would balance itself even if nearly broken. From the darkness caused by the council, came a new age of heroes! Adventurers would travel to those rifts willingly and slay their Gatekeepers thus closing it permanently before the breach could occur. Many brave souls were lost while trying to discover more about these rifts.

A scroll was created, detailing the historical events that led to the Rupture, as well as the rules of the rifts discovered by adventurers of that time.


>**Birth of the Rupture**
>
>We were fooled and betrayed by those we trust most. Sages have nearly exterminated all races by summoning the red crystal. It disappeared as soon as it touched the land it was summoned in, and then the first rift opened. We did not know anything about them and it was through sheer force of will and courage that we prevailed. I, King Velubran leave this scroll as a reminder to our descendants. If... No, when the crystal regains its power someone will have to fight all over again. What we your predecessors can do, is at least reduce the sacrifices needed. We are truly sorry to leave you with this perilous task.
>
>**Rules**:
>
>Number of Rifts appear depending on how many souls are gathered in one place, large cities means more Rifts
>Rifts can appear even in secluded caves, they can however be located by Sorcerers with sensitivity to spatial magic
>Rifts will take one full week, ten days, to mature before the breach happens
>Monsters within the Rift cannot exit until the Rift breaks, however anyone can enter it
>Gatekeepers are the ones whose power fuels the Rift, they are bound to it with their life force
>Only by killing the Gatekeeper can the rift be closed
>Once the Gatekeeper is slain it the Rift will be closed within one hour
>There can be more than one Gatekeeper
>I wish you the best of luck!
>

>Forever in your debt,

>King Velubran Landram Ren

Year 4562, 5th day of Eos, present day. Young tiefling was running towards the entrance of a large building that was plastered with a large title 'Adventurers Guild'.

`Ekvius, what brings you here in such a rush?` said the blond female while raising her head behind the counter. `Abi I bring urgent news from the Master!` replied the tiefling almost yelling. He was clearly flustered by whatever was happening, which made Abigale, guild officer and receptionist a bit wary. Young Ekvius was an apprentice of a well known mage in Grates, elven master wizard Heilen. So he was most likely not so excited for no reason at all. Abigale leaned forward slightly showing to Ekvius that he got her attention.

`He found it Abi! He found the location of the scroll of Ren! It's definitely real!` with great excitement in his voice he exclaimed. But the receptionists face went slightly pale. If that was true then... `Let us head to the Guildmaster, he can help us prepare for this... Hopefully it's not the worst possible scenario...` she barely whispered the second part. `What?` young wizard did not hear her, then Abi just waved it off with her hand as she proceeded to the door leading to the Guildmasters office.

Tomorrow morning a new request appeared on the board dedicated to official Guild business. A party of somewhat experienced adventurers is being summoned to help the Guild with an important matter.

>**Requester**: Guildmaster of Grates Adventurer Guild
>
>**Requirements**: Experienced adventurers
>
>**Request**: Travel to the specified location on the provided map and retrieve a scroll. Details will be provided personally.

From the revelation of scroll of Ren to this point in time passed little more than a month. Throughout this month Kingdom of Kigia became aware of Rifts what they are and how they could get ahead on the seemingly random slaughter that was occurring in their lands. Information on these *Dungeon Rifts* has just started to spread, so not everyone was in on it, but the Adventurers Guild has made a tremendous effort in spreading the news. Raiding parties were starting to rise up and venture into these dangerous lands to fight the Gatekeepers. One of the more famous ones was the group called *Lions Fang*, lead by a hunter and a paladin it was one of the groups that could boast huge clearance rate. Everyone everywhere was doing their best to fight for the worlds survival.

In Clifford, a small town just north of Grates, a middle aged man walked into a tavern, he was average height for a human, had a slightly longer ashen hair and a top hat. Although he seemed to be hunched and weary, his first few steps gave away what one could only call, purpose. Aura around him was nearly palpable, and even though he carried a sense of death around him, his very presence was calming. It was a very strange experience for the towns folk and patrons of the tavern. No one dared to disturb him.

Waitress got close slowly and spoke softly, as if not to rouse a beast that's sleeping nearby `After noon, good sir. Would you like some ale or grub?` He raises his head and 

```
Victor
```
looking around the room for a place to sit down `A warm meal would be nice, ma'am.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
`We have some venison ready, and some quail egg omelettes can be out fast...` she turned her torso towards a door behind her, probably what was a kitchen, like she forgot for a moment what was on the menu and tried to remember as quickly as possible. 

```
Victor
```
`That omelette sounds tasty. I'll take one of those, please.` With that, I sits at the nearest empty table.


```
Dungeon Master
```
`I'll tell the cook!` she made a wide smile when you made an order and briskly went towards the kitchen.  A realization struck you, the tavern name is "Quails Road", this must be their signature meal then. You smile a little upon realizing it and notice that even though it's somewhat rustic tavern, it is both busy and quiet at the same time. Feels like the town is doing good mostly, but it is burdened by something. Looks on patrons faces are not only worried by your presence, something else is amiss.
Interrupting your thoughts the waitress returns with a plate, and almost jovially places it before you.
`Enjoy your meal, sir! You can choose to make payment now, or when you are done.` upon saying that she shyly waits for his reply.

```
Victor
```
`Thank you. I would also like something to wash this wonderful meal down, please. Nothing fancy, just your regular ale. And here's the coin right away, ma'am, with a bit extra for being so kind to me.` As she goes to fetch the ale, I take off my hat, put in on the table next to the  plate and when the waitress returns with the drink I ask her `Oh, just one more thing, ma'am. I couldn't help noticing the tension around the town. Now, I am kinda used to superstitious looks wherever I go, but this... This is something more. Is everything alright?`

```
Dungeon Master
```
You give her 8 silver pieces and she gratefully accepts it. Right away, good sir! she says a bit louder than expected, as she leans towards you, and whispers Not here. Suddenly she straightens up and asks, again little louder Are you also looking for a place to stay?.

```
Victor
```
`I might as well, since I plan to stay for a day or two. I don't mind staying in the stables. Don't want to get your rooms all muddy. Oh, and this omelette... Mmhhhmmmm... Compliments to the chef.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
`Our stable boy will not be here for the next few days, you are more than welcome to stay in his... quarters near the stable. If that would make you feel more comfortable.` She points through a windows showing towards a small shack barely visible from this point, and then turns and leaves towards another table where the customer just walked in.

**Meanwhile**, in the vicinity of the inn, on a something one could call a small town square.
Sun was not yet setting, but it was close to dusk already. A lonely bard was sitting on a makeshift bench and telling stories of wild adventures. Some children were gathered around him, watching him all wide eyed while trying to mimic the heroes from the bards stories.
Seeing as the night is soon setting, he finished his song jumped up on the bench and took a deep bow while waving his hat gracefully in the air. Thanked the audience for their grace which amounted couple of copper coins, picked up his gear, and moved towards the closest inn in town.

The sign read, "Quails Road". Corp wondered if the name came because of what they served. Dismissing the needless thought he came in and looked around. Even with this gaudy outfit, they paid little mind to his entrance. Few glances here and there but was it. It was a solemn silence, with several whispers to be heard. As he suspected, the town was in some sort of trouble.

Corp was somewhat surprised it took him a little to notice an empty table, but upon seeing it he walked there and sat. While on his way, he couldn't help but notice a middleaged human talking to the waitress. He had a weird air about him, definitely not a merry type of person, Corp presumed. The smile he gave to the waitress and the way he carried himself, told him he seemed to be an honest person. A priest of sorts?
Slim brunette with a long, decently clean, hair, and a food stained apron around her thin waist has turned and got to his table.  Her mood was obviously a lot better than the rest of the folk in here. With a polite smile on her face said `Welcome to Quails Road, what would you like to have?`.

```
Corpos
```
`Hello, miss. Could you suggest some, not to expensive, but good meal?`

```
Dungeon Master
```

She sizes you up, there are many bards passing through but not many look to eat cheap food and keep, such a 'low' profile.
`Our quail egg omellete is always fresh and good. It goes for 6 silver pieces.`

```
Corpos
```
`That would be perfect. I will take one.`
As soon as she leaves I take one more cautious look a cross the room. To see if my past did not follow me here and to better assess the current atmosphere.

>Corpos makes a Perception check!
>1d20 (20) + 7 = 27

```
Dungeon Master
```
Fortunately, it would seem that you are safe for the time being. However, the doubt you had earlier is now a certainty. There is something going on in the city.
Clifford was a small town, which you would most probably just use as a stop on the way to perform in a larger setting while using the crowds to hide yourself more easily. But the change of plan was sudden when you heard the news of this town and entire countries financial progress has significantly improved in the last months. Seems like it was thanks to some Rifts or whatnot. Not that it matters, it would be foolish to let such an opportunity go to waste.

What is this towns problem then? Scanning through the room your eyes grab a glance of the man you noticed upon entry. He... he’s doing the same thing you are. Maybe, just maybe he might already know something. Its not that you need additional trouble. But the curiosity for a mystery is your weakness it almost always gets the better of you.

```
Corpos
```
For the time I wait for my meal and pay close attention on the ineresting figure.

```
Dungeon Master
```
After a little while the girl comes back and places the plate on your table gives you a short smile, says `Enjoy your food.` and leaves you to move behind a kitchen door only to get out again and serve a patron at another table.

Few hours before either of you entered the tavern, in Grates Hall of Adventure, two individuals were summoned to attend a briefing regarding the latest Rift appearance. The halls appearance was stunning, it was  at least 60 feet high room, with large open space in the middle cutting through all three floors. Large staircase was covering the half of the bottom floor and connecting to to the second. Second floor was entirely open and held in place with huge well decorated pillars. While the third floor was closed off and covered in windows.

At the top of the stairs leading towards the middle floor stood a statue of an archer with a pillar on each side, it was illuminated with a calming blue light, while at the bottom of the stairs, on the other half of the lower floor a large desk was placed, more than 15 feed long and at least 6 feed wide. Three people were standing there, each a different race. Meanwhile, right next to the staircase a door opens and another three persons enter.
Holding his helmet under his left armpit, a human clad in armor enters first, followed by a female elf with extremely calm expression. Third individual follows them only to give a short bow and close the door after them. Impressive as the hall may seem, they are un-phased, giving the feeling that they've been here before, and a few times at that. Quickly getting close to the table, they each give a short nod, and the first to speak is a female dwarf standing in the center.

`Apologies Lady Myst and Sir Artorigus, on such a short notice. The location this time is bit troublesome so it's best to avoid any risks.` her shoulder slump a little but quickly she reminds herself  that its not the time for that. `It's at entrance to the Cliffords church. People are saying all kinds of superstitious non-sense, so this is more trouble than a regular Rift.` On the left of her a human, wearing red and green robes speaks up `Are you able to move soon? Unfortunately this can become more than a trouble if we allow it to remain there. I'm sure you understand...` He looks at both of the adventurers and his look stays expectantly on Artorigus.

```
Myst
```
Nodding slightly in agreement, understanding necessity for haste in dealing with this problem.

```
Artorigus
```
I take the report and start looking over it. `Do we have any casualties?`

```
Dungeon Master
```
`Ney` says the dwarf, which you know by Elsyl, the vice chairman of Adventurers guild in Grates. `The Rift did not break yet, it only appeared.` From your experience you know that it should take about a week for the rift to be completed and allow creatures to pour out.
`Strength of the damn thing was measured to an approximate C rank. So it's a bit tougher one. Scouts were there, and as you can read in the report it is an empty entrance, so we don't know what to expect inside....`

```
Artorigus
```
`And these superstitious "nonsense" that the locals are mentioning, what is that about?` I switch the look from the report to the dwarf.

```
Dungeon Master
```
`They're saying the Gatekeepers are defying the Gods themselves and the Gods are not responding, so I'm guessing some of them have their faiths shaken. The problems are not regular folk... but the fanatic types. We don't know what to expect.` She raises her hand to massage her left temple, obviously tired and frustrated by the recent developments.

>Artorigus makes an Insight check!
>1d20 (12) + 0 = 12

Knowing the priests from Grates and surrounding towns, you can assume that the pressure they are making towards Adventurers Guild is probably worse than the Rift itself...

```
Artorigus
```
`Send the word, we will be there as soon as possible.` I turn my head to Myst. `Myst you ready?`

```
Myst
```
`Yes, Better to hurry with this, or people will start to be unsettled
We don't want someone to do something unnecessary, and cause more problems`

```
Artorigus
```
`Agreed, let's go.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
`Thank you...` says Elsyl, showing that she is greatly relieved. `Here is your usual upfront payment, we added a little extra, due to urgency.` She turns to Myst with the small jingling sack, that obviously holds coin. She knows you well enough to know that the Paladin in front of her is a man of virtue that does not like being paid for such things... This elf on the other hand...

>Myst makes a Perception check!
>1d20 (15) + 6 = 21

The bag is quite a bit heavier than what you usually receive. Knowing the finances of your raiding party, what you usually get is around 30g pieces for a D or 20g for a E rank Rift. Although this is a C rank this upfront is more than 40... no probably more than 50 gold...
Your costs per day for a full 7 party are approximately 2 gold.
But you are missing three members as of late, and you need to set out immediately. The Lions Fang has a room they call headquarters rented out, in the vicinity of the Hall of Adventure, and your own traveling wagon so your expenses are reduced to a point.

```
Myst
```
Reach out to take the coin bag, nodding in acceptance of payment, `We will do our best to resolve this as soon as possible`
Turning to Artorigus, `We should hurry, still need to gather up a party for this venture`

```
Dungeon Master
```
In order to set out immediately you leave Julia, a human fighter in your service to try and recruit more member and send them towards Clifford. Aside from her the caretaker of the establishment Carros, a tiefling is present as well. Not much of a combatant but a capable manager always very precise and dignified. This leaves only you two as fighting strength of the group... It'll have to do.
As you step outside, Tylor a younster coachman that usually drives you around, jumps up almost excited and asks Artorigus with a glow in his eyes. `Sir Art, where are we travelling now?!`

```
Artorigus
```
`I told you a million times not to call me "Sir", Artur is just fine` I say that as I turn to Tylor with a slight smile. `We are going to Clifford church this time around`

```
Dungeon Master
```
He jumps up on the wagon `Do we need to stop by supplies, is lady Julia coming?` words just keep bursting from him at high speed, while he stretches to get a look at the door behind you.


```
Artorigus
```
`She has some business to attend to so she wont be joining us as of now.` As I enter the chariot I say `We need to stop by The Lions Fang, I need to get my gear` With a stern voice I continue `Let's go time is of the essence!`

```
Myst
```
Entering the chariot, following Art.

```
Dungeon Master
```
Roads towards Clifford are mostly merchant roads, so they are well kept and the ride is mostly comfortable even in a hurry. The wagon is build for long and fast travels, it has 8 seats inside plus 3 more at the feedbox where Tylor sits. It's drawn by 3 horses, it was agreed that it should be 3 instead of two since you might have to carry a monster body back to town to use it for materials, or in case of emergency one horse can be removed to be ridden while two can maintain proper speed of the wagon.

The journey takes about 4 uneventful hours.
As you reach Clifford it is nearly dusk. Immediately all three of you notice what the vice chairman or well chairwoman has been talking about. A solemn silence fills the streets of Clifford as soon as sun starts setting, it leaves a bit earie vibe.
Tylor decides to slow down in the town streets not wanting to make an unneeded disturbance. It crosses both of your minds how well trained he has become. True asset to the group.
Upon pondering the thought, you see him moving the leather curtain that is dividing the feedbox from rest of the wagon, turns to peek inside and asks `Should I head towards the Inn? There should be one that's decent around here. Don't wanna meddle in your part of work, but I think we should find or wait for reinforcements.` He slowly turns his head back to the road but still keeps the curtain open, waiting for reply.

```
Artorigus
```
`It will be dark soon I suggest we stop and rest, grab something to eat and go see the rift in the morning, what do you suggest Myst?`

```
Myst
```
`Yea, its getting late, We can't do much today`

```
Dungeon Master
```
The carriage twist and turns in the town streets. Sound of wagon wheels is almost echoing the empty streets as you're passing by a building obviously being a town hall. Before long you arrive at the Quails Road Inn. Not an impressive establishment but you've seen worse... A lot worse.
Tylor stops the carriage and opens the curtain once more `Go on ahead I'll go handle the horses and join you.`
With that you can hear him go down from the feedbox and talking to horses to calm them down.

```
Victor
```
After finishing my meal, I pick up my hat, spade and backpack and walk out of the inn, heading towards stable boy's cottage.

```
Corpos
```
As he leaves, I leave money for my order with extra silver for service and follow him cautiously to see where is he going.

```
Dungeon Master
```
As Victor gets near the door with the Corpos several steps behind him, door opens suddenly! With two individuals standing at the doorway, a large armored male, most likely human, and a female elf.
Silence ensues.
