```
Myst
```
Opening the door of the inn, I look at Art `Maybe we can try and see if we can bolster our strength by finding more ppl here to help us closing this Rif...`
A bit startled I went silent, looking at figures standing close to us near the doorway.
```
Victor
```
`Oh... Sorry, Sir. Ma'am..` With a slight nod to both of them I let them enter then continue to the cottage.

>Corpos Silvereyes makes an Insight check!
>1d20 (20) + 4 = 24

```
Dungeon Master
```
Myst and Art stay in the doorway for a brief moment and observe the situation. The Paladin, currently lost in thought just glances over a middle-aged man and a halfling who's standing behind him. However, the elf noticed that that both the human and the halfling are not what they seem at first glance. They are not adventurers by definition of the Guild, but they have fought, she's sure of it.

Victor moves politely from the doorway and he meets the gaze of the elf standing next to the armored human. They are here on business, it must be related to whatever is going on in this town.

Meanwhile, Corpos has a moment of clarity, almost a brief glance into the future itself. These two and that gray haired guy... He realizes that he's here on a sort of pilgrimage, he wishes to help these people, and they are most likely the adventurers from Grates sent here on a mission. Meaning... There's a Rift in Clifford! And Rift means wealth and fame around these parts.

```
Corpos
```
With a lucky expression on my face.
`Well this day just became better. Hello, fellow adventurer's. My name is Corpos humble bard, what new exciting stories you have for me?`
And I bow for greeting.

```
Artorigus
```
Lost in my thoughts I just walk past the bard, and sit at an empty table.

```
Myst
```
`We just arrived for some Guild business`, nodding towards bard.
`Rift stories are most exciting than any other, don't you think?
But maybe instead of telling you one, you will be more interested in creating one?`
slightly moving my gaze from bard to human fellow

```
Corpos
```
Clearly confused by paladins passing by.
`Rifts, so rumors are true! That is an interesting offer miss. Can I hear more about it? I love good mysteries.`

```
Myst
```
`It is mystery for all of us regarding this one, I'm afraid`, shrugging a bit.
`All we know is that ppl speak about Clifford church and that some suspicious things happening there.Probably some superstitious nonsense. but its causing unrest among folks, so we come to investigate
If u interested to join us, there will be some upfront compensation. It is, after all, mid lvl normal Rift, so it will be dangerous endeavor.`

```
Artorigus
```
Turn my look towards Myst `You sure about this Myst, you remember what happened to the last fellow?` As I say that I turn my head to eye the bard.

>Artorigus makes an Intimidation check!
>1d20 (3) + 6 = 9

```
Myst
```
`If they are fine with this much danger, don't see the problem.` moving closer to Art
When I'm in range, I whispered `And I dont think we have that much time to find more people.`

>Corpos Silvereyes makes a Wisdom Save!
>2d20kh1 (8, 9) + 1 = 10

```
Dungeon Master
```
Corpos sees what the paladin is trying to do, and smirks a bit.
Meanwhile, Victor is moving towards the doorway to exit.

```
Artorigus
```
I shrug my shoulders and look at Myst, and sigh as I say `Right as always...you can brief him over supper.`

```
Myst
```
Looking at bard `You are more then welcome to join us for supper.`
`And your friend too`, slightly rising my voice, and looking towards human in the doorway `If he is interested in Rifts, of course.`

```
Corpos
```
With a bit suspicious expression.
`Oh you are wrong miss, we are not friends. We actually never met. But I am always interested to gain some extra coin. So I will listen to your offer.`
While joning them, I take better look on them to see if they have any suspicious markings.

>Corpos Silvereyes makes a Perception check!
>1d20 (20) + 7 = 27

```
Victor
```
Being prevented from leaving by the crowd at the door, I waited patiently for everyone to move. With that not being the case and by listening to the conversation in front of me, I decided to stick around a bit more.
`A rift, you say? Alright, I will hear you out.`
I join Artorigus at the table, putting my backpack back on the floor, leaning the spade against the nearby wall and taking off my hat again.

```
Dungeon Master
```
Corpus immediately noticed that these two are not wearing guilds emblem. Rather a woven mark on both their armor and traveling cloaks. Even their sacks have it. Its a single large fang within a contour of a lion... He knows this mark! They are Lions Fang! Holy moly aint this a lucky turn of events.
While engorsed in his thoughts, Corpos sees the human that remained silent so far removes a spade from his back and goes on to sit next to the armored man.

```
Corpos
```
`Well since we are all introduced now, shell we go over a details. `
With that I grab a sit next to lady.

```
Dungeon Master
```
All of you notice that waitress somewhat anxiosly approaches Myst and asks `Sorry to distrub you but all of you are making other patrons feeling unsettled. Could I ask you to sit and discuss your business there?` She blushes a lot while telling this, but remains firm.

```
Myst
```
`But of course, miss, We don't want to cause any disturbance here
Could I trouble you for some food and ale for me and my companions?`, looking toward others `If everyone is up for some refreshments?`

```
Corpos
```
`Since I just finished my meal, I wouldn't mind having some drinks. `
And gave her polite smile as a sign of appreciation.

```
Victor
```
`Just some water for me, thank you.`

```
Myst
```
`I could take some light meal and some ale to wash it down, miss, And sorry one more time if we cause any problems just before`, added with a apologetic smile.

```
Dungeon Master
```
She nods, and as you've all said what you wished to eat you can see her nodding with a blank stare, like she's trying to memorise it all.
`Not sure if we have something light other than some quail meat. Our speciality is quail omellete but not sure if that's alright or not...`notes with bit embarrassed look on her face, somewhat obvious that they don't really have that sort of requests often around here.

```
Myst
```
`Omelette will be just fine`, nodding with a smile `Thank you miss.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
With a nod she again look to the side, again trying to memorise it, and give a look to the large man in armor, expecting he also will say something.

```
Artorigus
```
`I will have the same` My expression staying unchanged.

```
Dungeon Master
```
Without a word she turns and rushes through the kitchen door.
Only four of you remain at the table, that is a bit further away from the door, not secluded but not really that close to the other bundle.

```
Victor
```
`So... A rift you say... Dangerous things they are. Or so I've heard...`

```
Myst
```
`Yes, they are, but that's what make them interesting.` looked at Victor with a smile `Especially unknown and mysterious, like this one.`

```
Victor
```
`I thought they were all unknown and mysterious. What makes this one more so than the others?`

```
Myst
```
`Usually we have some knowledge of what to expect in Rifts, so we can prepare, but now everything is a unknown. All we know is that this Rift is a bit stronger then usual.`

```
Corpos
```
While they talk I drifted into thoughts in try to recall any stories about similar Rifts.

>Corpos Silvereyes makes an Intelligence check!
>1d20 (10) + 3 = 13

```
Dungeon Master
```
As you are not a native of Kigia, you recall some bits and pieces of stories about champions and heroes stopping the monsters that are pouring out of portals. What you do know for sure is that Kingdom of Kigia has a big advantage regarding what they call Rifts. Perhaps it's due to their militaristic nature, but there could be more to it than that.
Some countries are not even aware of what is going on, and they simply register it as an increase in "demon beast" population. When in fact these portals are the ones behind it.
Demon beasts, it's how people from eastern continent are calling monsters.

```
Corpos
```
I snap out from my thoughts.
`How do you mean stronger? Did something come out of it already?!`

```
Myst
```
`Nothing yet, it is still closed. That is why I said it is a mystery`, added with a smile
`We are sent here as preventive party to check it out before something crawls out of it.`

```
Victor
```
`And you need help? I assume you have hands-on experience with these rifts. Do you expect something stronger than usual to... come out?`

```
Myst
```
`Yes, this one should be a bit stronger than usual. We are contacted because of unrest among people, so they needed experienced group to deal with this as quickly as possible.`

```
Victor
```
`Pardon me for saying, but you don't seem to be a very... large... experienced group. Even with our help. I mean, I can't speak for Corpos here, but I never had to deal with these rifts before.`

```
Myst
```
`We have few more members in our group, but they are on different duties at the moment`, slightly shifting look to Art.
`That is why we are in need for some more personnel for this request. And from what I can see, you are not that unfamiliar with fighting, so Rifts wont cause your any more problems than usual`, added looking at Victor.

```
Victor
```
With clear confidence in voice.
`Do not worry my friend, I have lots of experience with this thing's. And I am sure that these guys know what they're doing.`

>Myst makes an Insight check!
>1d20 (16) + 6 = 22

>Corpos Silvereyes makes a Deception check!
>1d20 (9) + 4 = 13

```
Dungeon Master
```
Corpos definitely has combat experience, that's obvious to a point. However, it was a blatant boast about the rifts. Does not seem to be with bad intentions. He's probably trying to assure his spot in the raid due to the reputation that followed you in these parts.

```
Victor
```
With a slight smile and in a bit lower voice I say `And just a few minutes ago he said we were not friends...`
Then I add louder `Alright, then. Name's Victor. Even if we fail, I hope I would, at least, be able to lead you to my Lord safely. Any plan?`

```
Corpos
```
`Oh ... Sorry, mate I did not mean to offend you. I just wanted to be polite. And did I say anything that was not true? We never met before.`

```
Myst
```
`Plan.... not so much for now, I'm afraid
We must first investigate damn thing, and then we will decide of a plan`, added with a smile `Too many unknowns around this Rift
But for now, we rest here tonight, and in the morning we go to the church.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
At this time, the waitress returns carrying two large plates with the food and drinks you’ve ordered. She nearly stumbles trying to put them on the table and start sorting it out. While placing the water in front of Victor says `Are you sure, sir that you wish only water?`

```
Victor
```
`Yes, ma'am, that's just fine. Thank you.`
Turning to Corpos, I add with a grin `No offence taken, don't worry. I was just amazed at how little time it took you to consider someone a friend.`

```
Corpos
```
With a friendly smile.
`Well, like I said. I was just being polite.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
`I... I... I'm really sorry to interrupt you. But this would be...` she makes small pause `11 silver and 2 copper pieces`.

```
Myst
```
`Thank you`, said with a smile while putting coins on the table (1g 3s).

```
Dungeon Master
```
`This is more than...` upon noticing your smile she gives a slight bow `Thank you very much!`

```
Myst
```
`Miss, can you recommend place where we can spend the night?`, slightly indicating on Art and myself.
`I presume you guys have that already taken care of?` looking at Victor and Corpos.

```
Corpos
```
A bit surprised with unexpected question and with smile.
`Well, of course...`

```
Dungeon Master
```
`We have two empty rooms here. It might be best if you don't wander around at night...`

```
Artorigus
```
That catches my attention `And why is that?` I turn my head with a stern look towards her as I ask.

```
Dungeon Master
```
Her eyes turn towards Artorigus instantly and she takes a strand of her hair and starts to nervously twist it in her hands.
Obviously scared, she can't even speak of the matter easily... Leaning towards all of you she whispers `Since everyone says the church is cursed, people were up to all sort of no good... Some girls were even... Luckily no one died...` She wanted to say "yet" but stopped herself like she didn't want to jinx it.

```
Artorigus
```
`Some girls were what?` I whispered back.

```
Victor
```
I choke on my water.

>Artorigus makes an Insight check!
>1d20 (11) + 0 = 11

```
Dungeon Master
```
As you’ve asked your question and looked at Victor who is now cleaning water from himself as a reaction, you realize that everyone is looking at you with blank stares...
A thougth emerges in your head *If they aren’t killed, they must’ve been raped...*

```
Artorigus
```
`I need some air...`  I get up and slowly get out the inn on the front door.

```
Myst
```
Looking at Victor and Corp, I whispered `This is clearly related to our work here. We should look at the church as early as possible in the morning`
Turning to waitress,`Miss, I would like to take that 2 free room here.
It will be for tonight only, with early breakfast, if that is ok?`

```
Dungeon Master
```
`Yes, yes. Let me bring you the keys.` She goes over and turns behind the counter, then returns to you with two similar keys. `Rooms are on the first floor, take those stairs.` points towards a staircase on the other side of the room.
`Rooms are 5 silver pieces per night, so this would be 1 gold piece for two rooms.`

```
Myst
```
Giving her the money `Thank you, miss.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
It was on this time that another young male enters the inn, somewhat irritated. It was Tylor. He joins you for a drink and explains that he was waiting for the stable guy to show up and in the end he had to do everything by himself.
After drinking for a while and getting to know each other you head in your rooms.

```
Corpos
```
As they go I stay a bit longer at the table order one more drink and check again how people react in room.

>Corpos Silvereyes makes a Perception check!
>1d20 (18) + 7 = 25

```
Dungeon Master
```
People are slowly starting to leave as it gets darker outside. Nothing special catches your eye that you already haven't noticed.

```
Artorigus
```
As I walk outside, I take a deep breath and just give a quick glance to my surroundings.
>Artorigus makes a Perception check!
>1d20 (5) + 0 = 5

```
Dungeon Master
```
Dusk has already set and progress into near darkness. Light mist was setting upon Clifford making it really quiet and somewhat scary. The feeling of calmness soothes your spirit while you observe the town and your thoughts wander off as you appreciate the moment.

```
Victor
```
Before I retire for the night, I ask the waitress `Excuse me, ma'am... Is there someplace I could find a quill and some parchment around here?`

```
Dungeon Master
```
Busy with another table, as most patrons are starting to leave the inn due to no one wanting to stroll around the town when it gets too dark. You wait for a few moments as she passes by you `Sorry sir, I was busy for a moment. what is it that you need?`

```
Victor
```
`I was just wondering if I could get some writing utensils around here. But it's alright, I see you are busy. I will just look for those in the morning. I wish you a good night, ma'am.`
I move out and go to stableboy shack, getting ready for sleep.

```
Dungeon Master
```
`Ah...` taking a second to look behind you she returns to her duties.
`See you in the morning sir Victor!` yelled young Tylor giving Victor a bright smile.

```
Victor
```
`And a good night to you, too, sir` I reply.

```
Dungeon Master
```
With a confused look Tylor waves, then looks back at the bard still sitting there` Quite a fellow sir Victor is, aint he? Calling me sir of all things` he smiles `My apologies sir Corpos I'll need to rest in order to be in shape to drive tomorrow, should we share the other room? Miss Myst will most likely be most comfortable around sir Art. They are friends after all.`
He gets up while waiting for response.

```
Corpos
```
`Well, I would not know. I just met him. And who are you again?` I look at him with a bit confusion on my face.
And then in an instant, I woke up from my thoughts and remember. `O yes, sorry I must be a bit drunk. Well it is kind suggestion, but I am not sure if that is ok with your masters.` As I was getting up, and almost fell down. `Ups ... Its late I should go...`

```
Dungeon Master
```
Tylor makes a confused expression. `They are not my masters! We're comrades. They fight the monsters, I drive them around. That's the business deal, and as I understood, from today on we are as well` he puts a smile on his face but somewhat strained.

```
Corpos
```
`Oh... Very sorry mate... My mistake...` bow down as a sign of apology `Well then, lead a way.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
Victor, as you step outside you meet the paladin still standing in front of the inn. Its as if he’s absorbing the neighborhood with his thoughts. His imposing presence somehow fits the scenery, you think.

```
Artorigus
```
`Something is definitely not right here, you can feel it in the air...` as I say that I straighten myself and leave for my room.

```
Dungeon Master
```
As you all return to your rooms and shacks to sleep, even thicker mist falls over Clifford, only to disperse in the morning.
Fresh morning air reaches Victors face and he can smell morning dew. It is a pleasant feeling to wake up this way, after a proper night in a decent bed.

```
Victor
```
I get up and I step outside and I take a deep breath and I get real high and I scream from the top of my lungs: `WHAT'S GOING ON... in that church!?`
After finishing my morning routine, I walk inside the inn for the breakfast.

```
Dungeon Master
```
Clifford being a town that houses farmers from nearby villages, and has a small market for trade of those goods, usually has more than few people on its streets early in the morning. It has become even busier lately due to people getting to bed even earlier. The cause was, of course, the happenings in the church and people resorting to all kinds of criminal activities during the night, as you have heard.
Upon yelling at the top of his lungs, literally everyone stopped in their tracks and turned to look who in the gods name has the audacity to say this out loud, let alone yell in the streets!
Taking a moment to see a bit weird middle aged man standing in front of the stables, everyone who's there makes  a mental note to avoid this person in the future and continues on their way.

```
Myst
```
I woke up, by influence of "someones" yelling. Took a few min to wake up completely, than casually leave room and move down for breakfast.

```
Corpos
```
While everyone was sleeping, in early morning hours. Drawn by thrill of mystery, Corpos was snooping around the town and church. And by the time Victore woke up he had back to inn, just to be surprised by his yelling. 
`Hello, there. I think you should keep your voice down` and with that joined him on his way to inn.

>Corpos Silvereyes makes an Investigation check!
>1d20 (11) + 8 = 19

Upon exiting the inn, it was still dawning and mostly dark. Cold morning air made you shiver for a moment, but it was a good feeling, it made you awake instantly. Moving through the streets towards town square where you performed yesterday, you make your way to town hall. Few people are already up and about, quickly walking with purpose. Upon reaching the church you see a sign posted in front. Sign reads DANGER Keep your distance RIFT AHEAD. Even out here, around 40 feet away from the entrance to the church you are able to hear a quiet buzzing sound coming from the closed doors of the building.
Curiosity gets the best of you and you get closer to open the door. Buzzing is now much louder, then a bright purplish pink tear in space itself is presented before you!
Surprised you step back, this was your first time seeing a Rift up close. Magic can be felt seeping through it, even with the mild knowledge that you have it is clear that this thing is dangerous.
Coming to your senses for a bit, you look about for details. It seems that besides windows it seems that the entrance to the church is completely blocked, as if someone purposely placed the Rift here. But that can't be right, you know that Rifts are randomly formed and it is not strange for them to appear in the city, or a town.
Satisfying your curiosity to a point you head back to the inn to meet with others.
Thinking as you make your way towards the inn were Rifts always purple and pink?. Your thoughts were interrupted by a loud shout from the direction of stables located next to Quails Road inn.
You greet your new comrade, and both of you head towards the inn.
There is only one person sitting at the tables this early. Waitress you met yesterday is not there, rather there's an older large woman, standing behind the counter together with a huge muscular man that's wearing a grey apron. They finish the discussion and she turns towards you as he ducks under the doorway and disappears behind the curtain that separated the kitchen from the main hall of the inn.
`Good morning fellas!` A bit deeper then expected voice comes out of the woman `I'm Grrreta, the innkeeper, what can I do you for?` A wide smile covers her even wider head, but she is not an unpleasant sight, a rather charming large woman, giving off that motherly feeling.
Looking about while she says that, you realise that Myst is that single patron sitting at the table. Probably waiting for everyone else to join.

```
Corpos
```
`Good morning to you too.` I said with friendly smile. `We are up for some good breakfast. And we will be joining lady over there.` Pointing her to direction of the table where Myst is sitting.

```
Dungeon Master
```
`Aaaall right! The gloomy one too?` She gives a sly smile while nodding towards Victor with her head.

```
Artorigus
```
As I make my way down, I look at Myst and say `Myst I'll go out and scout the church see what is happening, meet you there?`

```
Victor
```
`If that is alright, ma'am? Wouldn't want to cause any disturbance with my presence in your lovely inn.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
Looking at the Artorigus coming down from the stairs Greta turns as she hears Victors responding. `Of course, of course! Do not worry yourself. We've had worse and a lot less polite *patrons*. If you are concerned with that I can recommend a wash house here in town. Not a palace kind, so not perfect, but not too expensive either.` She winks at you and while making conversation moves towards the kitchen door then opens in and yells inside `DARRIL, TWO...` suddenly she stops and turns back to all of you. `Does sir knight and lady elf have needs for a breakfast too?`

```
Myst
```
`Wouldn't mind some hot food to keep me going through the day`, said with a subtle smile. `I have a feeling that we all will need all our strength for task in hand.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
Hearing Myst say that she turns towards Artorigus.

```
Artorigus
```
`I am good, thanks.` I look at Myst as I wait for her response.

```
Myst
```
`Fine by me, but be careful`, looking at Art, `We still don't know what is going on here, so watch yourself
We will be there shortly after breakfast, so just a light scouting pls`, added with a smile.

```
Dungeon Master
```
In the midst of that you hear another shout `DARRIL, THREE BREAKFASTS` and a bit distant response `YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT I'M NOT DEAF!` Greta turns with a satisfied smile on her face. `It'll be ready in a jiffy.`

```
Corpos
```
`So, Victor what's with yelling? And since you're man of faith, do you know something about this towns priests?`

```
Victor
```
`Oh... I... I was just taken by the moment. It was a beautiful morning. I just wish the people around here didn't have such a heavy burden on their backs these days.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
A slightly strange thing popped into Victors mind. There's a lot of talks about issues of the church that you've heard since coming to Clifford, but you haven't seen any priests, clerics or any sort of holy men so far. Not that you've been here long but since the issue is so obvious, you'd expect someone to try and calm the people down.

```
Victor
```
`As for the local clergy... I haven't really had the chance to meet any of them yet. Or even see one, now that you've mentioned it.`

```
Corpos
```
`Hmm, that seams strange don't you think?` I stop there for a moment to think. `Well, I couldn't resist not to snoop around a bit. So I saw strange thing this morning in the church. That rift kinda looks like it was purposely summoned there.`

```
Victor
```
I try to catch Greta's attention and when I do I ask `Excuse me, ma'am... A question if I may... Aren't local priests doing anything to calm the tension in Clifford?`

```
Dungeon Master
```
Greta turns to Victor with almost a sad face, but she corrects it immediately and smiles, `That lot? They've all 'went on a pilgrimage' when that thing appeared. Saying things like their god needs them or whatever... Personally... I think them to be no more than a chicken. They all ran away.`

```
Victor
```
`ALL of the town's priests? That's bad... And VERY strange. They didn't leave anyone to provide some kind of divine help to those in need? Or to look after the church at least? I guess there are no other temples in the town? Sorry for asking all these questions, but all this sounds very unusual...`

```
Dungeon Master
```
`Yes, they all left, and no, just that one. This was more of a village than a town until few years ago, but with King making some important deal with adventurers guild everything started expanding fast. Especially near Grates.` A deep manly voice belonging to Darril was heard from the kitchen `THREE BREAKFASTS` and a warm smile covered Gretas face before entirely disappearing to make way for her yelling face `COMING`.

```
Artorigus
```
I walk down the streets and make my way towards the church.

```
Victor
```
To Myst and Corpos `That is most unsettling. From what I know, even when it comes to some big and important pilgrimage or a crusade, someone is always left to watch over a temple. At least an elderly priest too frail to endure the jurney and an initiate or two. I don't think them being cowards is the real reason for that. Something else is at play here.`

```
Myst
```
`Strange indeed. Maybe Art will get some info on that until we join him.`

```
Victor
```
`Let us make it a quick breakfast, then. I don't like the fact that he went alone.`

```
Myst
```
`Agreed.`

```
Dungeon Master
```
Greta brings your breakfast and you quickly eat it, Tylor seems to be sleeping still but its a small town and you won't really be needing a ride.

```
Myst
```
`We should get going, Art is waiting for us`, slowly started to get up after finish eating breakfast.

```
Corpos
```
`I agree.` While stending up I leave 1g coin on table.
